# Project 3: HealthLens – Understanding Patient Data & Health Trends

---

## 📊 Dataset

**Title:** Heart Disease UCI Dataset 
**Download Link:** [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci)

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

You're part of a healthcare analytics team that works with patient diagnostics and lifestyle indicators. The goal is to analyze patient health records and extract insights into heart disease patterns, risk factors, and population-level trends. This is a real-world analytics challenge—your choices in analysis and presentation matter.

Use your skills in data handling, SQL/statistics, and visual storytelling to answer questions that matter.

---

## ❓ Suggested Questions to Explore

- What factors (age, gender, cholesterol, etc.) are associated with heart disease?
- Is there a significant difference in heart disease presence between male and female patients?
- Does maximum heart rate (thalach) differ by age group or disease status?
- Is fasting blood sugar related to heart condition?
- What is the relationship between chest pain type and heart disease risk?
---

## 🧹 What Should Be Included

### 🔧 Data Cleaning

- Rename technical column names (e.g., `cp`, `thalach`) to meaningful labels
- Identify and handle missing or abnormal values
- Convert categorical variables to interpretable form (e.g., chest pain types)

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Use Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Pandas)
- Create graphs like count plots, KDE plots, box plots, pair plots
- Examine distribution of target variable (presence of disease)

### 💡 Insight Generation

- Find correlations or patterns
- Apply grouping/aggregation to compare groups
- Apply basic statistical tests (T-test, Chi-square)

---

## ⚙️ Optional Add-ons

- SQL for subgroup analysis (e.g., AVG cholesterol by age/gender)
- Interactive visualization with Python libraries
